# Global Tourism Analysis Using Tableau 🌍  

## 📋 Project Description  
This project explores global tourism trends across 7 countries. Using Tableau, I created interactive dashboards to analyze revenue, visitors, and accommodation availability by categories like Adventure, Cultural, Nature, and more.

## 📊 Key Dashboards:  
1. **Tourism Map**: Interactive world map showing visitors by country and category.  
2. **Revenue Analysis**: Bar and line charts comparing total revenue and category breakdowns.  
3. **Accommodation Insights**: Charts displaying available accommodations by country.  

## 🛠 Tools Used:  
- Tableau Desktop  
- Microsoft Excel (data preparation)  

## 📈 Key Insights:  
- **Egypt** generates the highest tourism revenue ($460M), with significant contributions from cultural and adventure tourism.  
- The most popular categories globally are Adventure (17.6%) and Urban tourism (17.2%).  
- **Accommodation availability** correlates with higher tourist numbers in countries like India and Egypt.
